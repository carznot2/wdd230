            <h3>White Space</h3>
            <h4>Telus</h4>
            <a href="https://www.telus.com/en" target="_blank">www.telus.com</a>
            
            <img src="images/telus.jpg" alt="Image Telus Website">
            <p>I like that it has white space between the graphics and the text, and that the graphics are interesting and 
                make it friendly at the same time. They use lots of space between graphics, margins, and the text. It makes
                it a friendly site to visit and is certainly not cluttered! It is a clean site design. </p>

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h4>Air Canada</h4>
            <a href="https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home.html" target="_blank">www.aircanada.com</a>
            
            <img src="images/aircanada.jpg" alt="Image Air Canada Website">
            <p>For different users this website has more important features for some users, than for others. 
                I might be interested in arranging a flight, or I could be simply interested in planning my next 
                vacation and the website caters to both. It is also not cluttered which I like.</p>

            <h3>Hicks Law</h3>
            <h4>Amazon</h4>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a>
            
            <img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon Website">
            <p>Hickâ€™s Law because with the many options Amazon has available they make it easy to select a product because of the filters 
                they have in place. I can also look back on items recently purchased.</p>
